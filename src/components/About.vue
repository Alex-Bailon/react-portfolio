      <p>Full-Stack Web Developer with a background in customer service ensuring that customers are always fully satisfied with the product and service they receive. Recently earned a certificate in Full Stack Development from Northwestern University, with developed skills in JavaScript, CSS3, React.js/Vue.js, and responsive web design. Having analytical problem solving skills and adaptableness, worked alongside a team to efficiently create and develop mobile-first applications. With everyone’s contribution and the use of MERN ( MongoDB, Express, React, Node), the team and I were able to successfully create a dog dating app that allows users to create a user login and swip on other dogs to set up a play date. Optimistic to support a fast-paced, quality-driven team to build better experiences on the web for users and customers.</p>
      <p>Currently a Junior Developer for Fusion92. I provide back-end and front-end support to clients and projects. I work with Project Managers, Account Supervisors, and Development team to build full stack applications to deliver on client's expectations. To develop a full stack application I use Nodejs/Express for backened, Nuxt/Vue for server-side rendering of the frontend, mongoDB/Mongoose as a database, and Docker to make deploying hasslefree.</p>
      <p>Part time, I am part of the instructional staff for web development bootcamps. Decided to teach web development on my free time becuase developing is something I really enojoy and have a passion for. Plus what greater satisfaction than to be able to watch students grow, succeed and overcome challenging obstacles that they never thought they could overcome.</p>
